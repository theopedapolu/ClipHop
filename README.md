## Report Bugs/Give Feedback
This app is a pet project of mine, and I try to actively maintain it whenever I'm free. There are still some edge cases I haven't gotten around to handling and a non-trivial set of bugs I'm sure the app contains that I'm not aware of. If you find a problem in the app or simply want to provide feedback about the UI or functionality in general, feel free to [DM me on Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=1269431990731882496)
